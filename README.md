# Violence-Detection-and-Categorization

The purpose of violence detection is to determine whether or not a violent action has occurred. This topic grew in popularity due to the need to develop appropriate and automatic violence detection systems that investigated visual data obtained from security cameras positioned in various regions. In this work, we used pre-trained deep neural networks to provide a low-complexity strategy for detecting violence. To detect whether a violent action happened, the extracted features from pre-trained models were pooled and given into a fully-connected layer.

The main objectives of our architecture are to handle pose estimation, recognition, and classify whether an action is violent or not, and if it's violent, we'll further attempt to classify it from the subsequent four classes that are: arrest, assault, arson (purposely setting properties on fire), and abuse. 
The final module is training, which has two parts. 
1.	The first implementation is our own way, which is our normal CNN model, which has 3 dense hidden layers with Relu as their activation functions, and every single layer is accompanied by dropouts to challenge the system. The final output is done through the SoftMax activation function for our multi-class problem in order to classify violence into the four classes: arrest, assault, arson, and abuse, and the one with the highest probability value is the violent action if it's greater than 0, that is, if it's violent, which returns a probability distribution which adds up to 1. The results were kind of overfitting with a 0.9992 ROC AUC score. 

2.	The second method employs a pre-trained model. The system's structure is made up of CNN, which is made up of prediction blocks (PB), downscaling units (DU), and upscaling units (UP) (UU). The Prediction block (PB) within the CNN handles the pose prediction and action prediction. Once the system training is done, the transfer learning procedure is used. The key advantage of the transfer learning methodology is that it scales better for the current application of violence recognition and has low computing demand and complexity. We scaled the frames before delivering them to the model to acquire the features. With the help of a feature vector, we perform max pooling, which is usually added at the end of a CNN. This is done to further decrease the computational load and once again improve the overall efficiency. The resultant output is a feature vector after the transfer learning method is applied. Finally, the output is fed into a convolution neural network with ReLu and, as before, it has a SoftMax output layer, which returns a probability distribution which adds up to 1, as mentioned in the first part. As we know, the final goal is to classify whether or not an action is violent. Hence, if the final output corresponds to a probability distribution from the values 0 to 1, which adds up to 1, as the figure below, the action is classified as violent and with the highest probability class as the output from those four violent classes, whereas if the final output corresponds to Zero (0), the ferocious lawbreaking action is classified as non-violent.

The transfer learning + CNN sequential style methodology achieved a very good accuracy of 0.9364 for the violent categorization task, showing that this model is the finest solution to our paper. The journey, however, doesn't conclude here. We will use these models on various devices, like CCTV and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). With this framework and also the growth of technology, the prices of the equipment resources needed have become more affordable, and with the cooperation of presidency agencies, the system may well be further improved and made far more efficient by progressing with the plan of pruning the models so as to form them ready to be deployed on devices with low internal memory units, and that we could install violence sensors in schools, restaurants, airports, and other public places so the authorities will receive an alert on the server and display the live footage to them.
